Introduction
------------
This is a simple utility, intended to make my life easier when editing
*asciidoc*.

It will watch a _.asciidoc_ file compiling it to HTML and displaying the new
version whenver the original _.asciidoc_ file is changed.

It can also be used with plain HTML (_.html_) files, in which case it will not
attempt to call asciidoc.

Build Requirements
-------------------
 * cmake (2.8+)
 * libqt4-dev
 * libqtwebkit-dev

Usage
-----
[source,shell]
# ./qinotify README.asciidoc
