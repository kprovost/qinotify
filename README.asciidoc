Introduction
------------
This is a simple utility, intended to make my life easier when editing
*asciidoc*.

It will watch a _.asciidoc_ file compiling it to HTML and displaying the new
version whenver the original _.asciidoc_ file is changed.

This is very convenient in combination with a tiling window manager: half of
the screen is a *Vim* session with the asciidoc source, the other half is the
HTML result. The HTML is updated whenever the edits to the source file are
saved.

It can also be used with plain HTML (_.html_) files, in which case it will not
attempt to call asciidoc.

Build Requirements
-------------------
 * cmake (2.8+)
 * libqt4-dev
 * libqtwebkit-dev

Usage
-----
[source,shell]
----
# ./qinotify README.asciidoc

FAQ
---
Why doesn't this also include an editor?::
  Vim is better than anything I could come up with. Besides, Vim already exists.

TODO
----
 * Add a status bar (bottom, below HTML view) with last updated time.
 * Add quit button (optional..)
 * Additional viewer support (i.e. for .sdedit PNGs)?
